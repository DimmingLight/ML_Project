# Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Classification Using Random Forest
## Project Overview
This project is a group assignment of machine learning class LD01. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify the presence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) based on various health parameters. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Cardiovascular Disease dataset. The dataset contains information about patients' health metrics and whether they have CVD or not.

## Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Overview   
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) refers to a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. It includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and other conditions. CVD is a leading cause of death worldwide, emphasizing the importance of early detection and preventive measures.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.   

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
